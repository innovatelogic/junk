        First, b1 is default initialized. 
        All members are initialized before the body of the constructor, 
        so b1.a is default initialized first, and we get the output 14.

        §12.6.2¶8 in the standard: "In a non-delegating constructor,
        if a given non-static data member or base class is not designated by a
        mem-initializer-id (...) then if the entity is a non-static data member that has
        a brace-or-equal-initializer, the entity is initialized as specified in §8.5 (...) otherwise, 
        the entity is default-initialized."

        Then, b2 is initialized with the move construcor 
        (since std::move(b1)converts the reference to b1 to an xvalue, 
        allowing it to be moved from.) In B's move constructor, a is initialized in the initializer list.
        Even though a is an rvalue reference (and bound to an rvalue),
        a itself is an lvalue, and cannot be moved from. b2.a is then copy initialized, printing 2, 
        and finally the body of B's move constructor prints 6.

        (If the concept of rvalue references being lvalues is confusing, 
        read http://isocpp.org/blog/2012/11/universal-references-in-c11-scott-meyers . Search for "In widget".)
